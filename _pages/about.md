Hi! I'm Yuxuan (Ethan) Mao, an M.S. student in Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern University. Before this, I worked as an embedded development engineer at Espressif, known for its ESP32 platform. I earned my B.S. (Hons.) in Mechanical Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2022, where I received multiple honors for academic and research performance, including Excellent Bachelor's Thesis (top 1%) and the Shanghai Scholarship (1/206).

My research interests include actuator mechanisms, wearable robotics, and stretchable electronics. Currently, I‚Äôm conducting research at the Simpson Querrey Institute for Bioelectronics under the supervision of Prof. John A. Rogers, focusing on multi-modal actuators and soft robotics, particularly in the areas of haptics and organoid interfaces. Since 2020, I have led or contributed to seven papers published in top journals, including Nature and Science, and presented 2 oral reports at international conferences. My expertise spans a wide range of mechatronics skills, including rapid prototyping, micro-fabrication, and embedded programming.

As an INTJ (Introverted-Intuitive-Thinking-Judging), I‚Äôm known for resilience, strategic thinking, and a passion for technology. Outside of academics, I enjoy playing and singing R&B on the ukulele, playing basketball, and exploring science fiction, mystery, and epic stories.
