<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I'm Yuxuan, an M.S. student in Mechanical Engineering at **Northwestern University**. Before this, I worked as an embedded development engineer at Espressif, known for its ESP32 platform. I earned my B.S. (Hons.) in Mechanical Engineering from **Shanghai Jiao Tong University** in 2022.

<br>
My research interests include **actuator mechanisms**, **wearable robotics**, and **stretchable electronics**. Currently, I‚Äôm conducting research at the Simpson Querrey Institute for Bioelectronics under the supervision of Prof. John A. Rogers, focusing on multi-modal actuators and soft robotics, particularly in the areas of haptics and organoid interfaces. My expertise spans a wide range of bio-mechatronics skills, such as rapid prototyping, micro-fabrication, embedded programming and machine learning.

<br>
As an INTJ (Introverted-Intuitive-Thinking-Judging), I bring **resilience**, **strategic thinking**, and a genuine **passion for technology** to my work. Outside of academics, I enjoy playing and singing R&B on the ukulele, playing basketball, and exploring science fiction, and epic stories.
