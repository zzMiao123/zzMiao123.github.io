<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I'm Yuxuan, an M.S. student in Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern University. Before this, I worked as an embedded development engineer at Espressif, known for its ESP32 platform. I earned my B.S. (Hons.) in Mechanical Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2022.

My research interests include **actuator mechanisms**, **wearable robotics**, and **stretchable electronics**. Currently, I‚Äôm conducting research at the Simpson Querrey Institute for Bioelectronics under the supervision of Prof. John A. Rogers, focusing on multi-modal actuators and soft robotics, particularly in the areas of haptics and organoid interfaces. My expertise spans a wide range of mechatronics skills, including rapid prototyping, micro-fabrication, and embedded programming.

As an INTJ (Introverted-Intuitive-Thinking-Judging), I bring resilience, strategic thinking, and a genuine passion for technology to my work. Outside of academics, I enjoy playing and singing R&B on the ukulele, playing basketball, and exploring science fiction, mystery, and epic stories.
